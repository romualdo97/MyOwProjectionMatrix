# Calculating the projection matrixt
This is a simple OpenGL program written to test my understanding on the OpenGL projection matrix.

You can read the [Scratch a pixel article](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/perspective-and-orthographic-projection-matrix/opengl-perspective-projection-matrix) on matrices to understand the theory behind the projection matrix and how to derive it.
