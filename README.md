# Calculating the projection matrixt
This is a simple OpenGL program written to test my understanding on the OpenGL projection matrix.

You can read the [Scratch a pixel article](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/perspective-and-orthographic-projection-matrix/opengl-perspective-projection-matrix) on matrices to understand the theory behind the projection matrix and how to derive it.

# Experiments
A summary of the experiments.

- Write shader class using the RAII idiom.
- Follow the C++ rule of five, i.e.: Implement copy constructor, copy assign, move constructor, move assign and destructor for the `Shader` class.
- Write the projection matrix from scratch and send as uniform to the GPU.
